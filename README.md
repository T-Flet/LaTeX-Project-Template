LaTeX Project Template
===

This is a LaTeX project folder from which to begin working on a new document;
its structure avoids clutter and facilitates the use of some packages and tools.
Text-wise it contains only a few paragraphs across the sections in order to present the document structure and showing how to use common environments and utilities.

The project folder contains:

- A `.vscode` folder containing some basic configuration for the popular [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) VS Code extension, with two ready-made compilation sequences (one with xelatex and Biber, the other with pdflatex and bibtex)
- An `Img` folder in which to place any image to use in the document, which is already configured in `Packages.sty` so that invoking an image can be done without path a(e.g. `\includegraphics[width=9cm]{IMAGE_NAME}`)
- A `Progress` folder (generated by the `compile_diff.ps1` script), there just to showcase its output structure, and which should be deleted before first script use on a new project, otherwise the first diff will be from the template itself
- A `Submitted` folder to contain the document as it was submitted, e.g. multiple files submitted at various stages and with particular naming conventions, which are kept apart from the actual project development
- A `TeX` folder containing any and all chapter/section files to be imported into the main .tex outside of it (`Report.tex`)
- A standard TeX `.gitignore`
- The four PowerShell scripts from the [LaTeX-Diff-Scripts repository](https://github.com/T-Flet/LaTeX-Diff-Scripts), which automate all compilation needs: simple compilation, compilation in a single .tex file, generation of a diff pdf from either a past commit or from the last saved version (automatically generated each time in the Progress folder). The compilation commands in `compile.ps1` should be inspected and modified to suit one's requirements before first use
- A `Packages.sty` file for neat inspection and modification of package use and configuration
- The main .tex file, `Report.tex`, which is where document structure is organised: the only content directly present is title, author and abstract, then everything else is structure around imports from the `TeX` folder (sections and appendices, including acronyms, definitions and bibliography)



Dependencies & Configurations
===

Compilation:
- Inspect and configure the commands in `compile.ps1`. The default first and last step is xelatex, which supports font packages; if choosing to use pdflatex instead, the fontspec package will not work, so remove font-related settings in `Packages.sty`
- See the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) for info on the 4 scripts and their dependencies (only the diff ones need extra ones)

Packages (see `Packages.sty`):
- Prompts to install various packages may appear on first compilation
- The default monospace typeface is set to JetBrains Mono, which needs to be installed.
Here are [details on its design](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/), and you can find an up-to date version of it with additional symbols on [this page](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
Alternatively select a different typeface or just comment out those lines.
- If not using Biber, edit the bibliography lines accordingly



Style
===

- Labelling convention: have the object type as the first few characters before a colon ('type:name'):
`ch` for Chapter, `sec` fo Section and Sub-Section, `fig` for Figure, `tab` for Table,
`eq` for Equation, `lst` for Listing, `def` for Definition, `ex` for Example, `rem` for Remark, thm for Theorem, lem for Lemma.
- Always use 'noitemsep' in list environments, e.g. `\begin{description}[noitemsep]`
- 3 empty lines between sections
